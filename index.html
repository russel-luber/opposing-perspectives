      <h2>Proposition: Officers with more complaints face less accountability.</h2>

          <figcaption>Scatterplot showing that officers with many complaints often have few confirmed violations, falling far below the line of perfect accountability.</figcaption>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Added a diagonal “perfect accountability” reference line, setting an ideal baseline. (Score: 1)</li>
          <li>Plotted all officers with semi-transparent points to emphasize density and structural failure. (Score: 1.5)</li>
          <li>Annotated outliers with many complaints but few confirmed violations, highlighting extremes. (Score: 1)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Binned officers into complaint quintiles and computed average confirmed violations. (Score: 1)</li>
          <li>Chose bar chart to present upward trend visually, implying increasing accountability. (Score: 1)</li>
          <li>Used neutral ColorBrewer palette to project professionalism and readability. (Score: 1)</li>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          This project made me realize how subtle design choices can dramatically shift the framing of a visualization. Even neutral-seeming decisions like adding a reference line or choosing a threshold embed specific expectations about what “accountability” should look like. Designing two opposing visualizations forced me to see how the same dataset can plausibly support contradictory interpretations.

        <p>
          One surprise was how easily “earnest” charts could still be highly persuasive without resorting to misleading practices. However, I also noticed how annotation, binning, and color framing naturally push readers toward certain conclusions. Ethical visualization, I learned, is less about avoiding persuasion altogether and more about signaling your framing honestly. Transparency about structure and aggregation choices is essential to maintaining fairness, especially on controversial topics like policing.
