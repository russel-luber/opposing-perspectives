      <h2>Proposition: Officers with more complaints face less accountability.</h2>

        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/for1_viz.png" alt="Scatterplot: Complaints Stack Up" width="800" />
          <figcaption>Scatterplot showing that officers with many complaints often have few confirmed violations, falling far below the line of ideal accountability.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Encoded total complaints on the x-axis and substantiated complaints on the y-axis. Plotted all officers as dots and added a diagonal line representing ideal accountability (one confirmed/substantiated violation per complain)</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The line assumes that every complaint <em>should</em> be substantiated, which is not necessarily a reasonable expectation. It imposes a moral baseline rather than an institutional one. In reality, there are such things are false reports of misconduct. However, it does make you question why there are so many unsubstantiated complaints compared to substantiated ones, which opens the door to further analysis.
              </li>
            </ul>
          <li>Used transparent points and full axis scales to emphasize the volume of low-accountability cases.</li>
          <li>Added a textual annotation to highlight outliers (officers with 45+ complaints but few confirmed violations). This helps the reader interpret what is going on in the scatterplot.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/against1_viz.png" alt="Bar Chart: More Complaints, More Accountability?" width="800" />
          <figcaption>Bar chart showing that officers with more complaints also tend to have a higher average number of confirmed violations.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Encoded complaints volumen into quantile bins (fifth quantiles) along the x-axis.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Binning officers into quantiles normalizes the distribution and enables fair comparison across complaint volumes. It makes patterns more visible without being distorted by outliers.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Mapped average number of confirmed/substantiated violations per bin to the height of the bars.</li>
          <ul> 
            <li>
              The bar height provides a clear, intuitive encoding of accountability levels. It visually reinforces the message that more complaints correlate with more confirmed violations.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Used neutral, professional color palette (ColorBrewer set2) for the bars to ensure readability.</li>
          <li>Franed the title as a question rather than a conclusion to invite readers to question the proposition.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          This project made me deeply aware of how much framing and aggregation choices shape what a viewer takes away from a visualization. There really is just a garden of forking paths when it comes to design choices as a data analyst and visualizer. The same underlying data — in this case, NYPD officer complaints — can be used to argue opposing conclusions based on how it's grouped, binned, or annotated.
        </p>

        <p>
          I found that even decisions I considered "neutral" in the moment introduced a framing effect. It became clear that rhetorical power often hides in unquestioned conventions.
