      <h2>Proposition: Officers with more complaints often face less accountability.</h2>

        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Encoded total complaints on the x-axis and substantiated complaints on the y-axis. Plotted all officers as dots and added a diagonal line representing ideal accountability (one confirmed/substantiated violation per complain)</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The line assumes that every complaint <em>should</em> be substantiated, which is not necessarily a reasonable expectation. It imposes a moral baseline rather than an institutional one. In reality, there are such things are false reports of misconduct. However, it does make you question why there are so many unsubstantiated complaints compared to substantiated ones, which opens the door to further analysis.
              </li>
            </ul>
          <li>Used transparent points and full axis scales to emphasize the volume of low-accountability cases.</li>
          <li>Added a textual annotation to highlight outliers (officers with 45+ complaints but few confirmed violations). This helps the reader interpret what is going on in the scatterplot.</li>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

          <img src="images/against1_viz.png" alt="Bar Chart: More Complaints, More Accountability?" width="800" />
          <figcaption>Bar chart showing that officers with more complaints also tend to have a higher average number of confirmed violations.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Encoded complaints volumen into quantile bins (fifth quantiles) along the x-axis.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Binning officers into quantiles normalizes the distribution and enables fair comparison across complaint volumes. It makes patterns more visible without being distorted by outliers.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Mapped average number of confirmed/substantiated violations per bin to the height of the bars.</li>
          <ul> 
            <li>
              The bar height provides a clear, intuitive encoding of accountability levels. It visually reinforces the message that more complaints correlate with more confirmed violations.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Used neutral, professional color palette (ColorBrewer set2) for the bars to ensure readability.</li>
          <li>Framed the title as a question rather than a conclusion to invite readers to question the proposition.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          In this project, I tackled the proposition that "Officers with more complaints often face less accountability" by designing two opposing visualizations. 
          It quickly became clear that even small design choices — framing a baseline, picking an axis scale, deciding when to bin — can dramatically influence a reader’s interpretation.
        </p>

        <p>
          My FOR visualization was a scatterplot mapping total complaints against confirmed violations for each officer. 
          I added an ideal accountability line where every complaint would be substantiated.
          Officers falling far below that line told a visual story of disconnect: complaints stacked up, but consequences didn't.
          In doing so, I treated the proportion of substantiated complaints as a proxy for true accountability — a simplification, but a powerful one that helped surface the systemic gap the proposition pointed toward.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the flip side, my AGAINST visualization grouped officers into complaint volume bins and plotted the average number of confirmed violations.
          Binning cleaned up a lot of individual noise and let broader patterns show through.
          As complaint volume rose, so did average accountability outcomes.
          It wasn’t a perfect linear relationship, but the upward trend pushed against the idea that complaints are ignored wholesale.
        </p>
        <p>
          What surprised me most was how "earnest" decisions could still be persuasive — or even rhetorical — depending on how they framed the data. 
          In both visualizations, I made calls about what to center, what to compress, and what to highlight.
          Ethical visualization isn’t about embodying neutrality; it’s about being honest about the story you're suggesting, and leaving space for the viewer to question it.
          That’s the line I tried to walk.
