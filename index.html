      <h2>Proposition: Officers with more complaints face less accountability.</h2>

        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/for1_viz.png" alt="Scatterplot: Complaints Stack Up" width="800" />
          <figcaption>Scatterplot showing that officers with many complaints often have few confirmed violations, falling far below the line of perfect accountability.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Plotted all officers as dots and added a diagonal line representing perfect accountability \(one confirmed violation per complain\)</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The line assumes that every complaint <em>should</em> be substantiated, which is not necessarily a reasonable expectation. It imposes a moral baseline rather than an institutional one. In reality, there are such things are false reports of misconduct.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>I used transparent points and full axis scales to emphasize the volume of low-accountability cases. </li>
          <li>Annotated outliers with many complaints but few confirmed violations, highlighting extremes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/against1_viz.png" alt="Bar Chart: More Complaints, More Accountability?" width="800" />
          <figcaption>Bar chart showing that officers with more complaints also tend to have a higher average number of confirmed violations.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Binned officers into complaint quintiles and computed average confirmed/substantiated violations.</li>
          <li>Chose bar chart to present upward trend visually, implying increasing accountability. (Score: 1)</li>
          <li>Used neutral ColorBrewer palette to embody professionalism and readability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          This project made me deeply aware of how much framing and aggregation choices shape what a viewer takes away from a visualization. There really is just a garden of forking paths when it comes to design choices as a data analyst and visualizer. The same underlying data — in this case, NYPD officer complaints — can be used to argue opposing conclusions based on how it's grouped, binned, or annotated.
        </p>

        <p>
          I found that even decisions I considered "neutral" in the moment introduced a framing effect. It became clear that rhetorical power often hides in unquestioned conventions.
